											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p> My name is Lucy Power and I am currently studying Computer Games Development at Staffordshire University. I have always been passsionate for games and I aspire to be apart of the next generation of game developers creating games
											to bring enjoyment to the world. I'm self-employed at uTest.com where I have gained skills in application testing and communicating with team leaders. I am also currently employed at the Student's Union, working in the university bar. </p>

										<p> In my free time I partake in extra-curricular activities and hobbies. As of the 2023-2024 academic year, I am apart of the Cheerleading team and the Rock, Alt and Metal Society. In previous years, I was also apart of the
											hockey team, filling the role of Game Day and Social Media Secretary on the committee. Outside of university and gaming, I spend a lot of my time exploring my creative side through the means of crocheting and cross-stitching,
											often combining my love of gaming by creating game characters for both myself and others as gifts. </p>

										<h3> Virtual Reality : Bowling </h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/bowling.png" alt="" /></span>

										<p> C# || Unity </p>
										<p> This game aimed to simulate bowling within VR. The player can play a full 10-round game of bowling, almost identical to that found in the real world. The only main difference is that the points
										system found within this game is different. Instead of the score being multiplied based off of strikes and spares, the pins knocked down are merely added to the score as they are. Each round of bowling
									 	lets the player throw the ball twice, the only exceptions are if the player gets a strike, or on the final round where if the player knocks down all of the pins, they get a third throw, such as is present
										in real life bowling. If the player drops the ball before they have bowled, the ball will respawn on the table so that the player does not miss out on a throw. </p>
										<p> The player is able to move around the environment via teleportation anchors which are placed around the map in various key places. The environment also features doors which can be opened by the player,
										 	grabbable objects that can be moved around the map, snappable locations for the bowling balls on the table, and customisation of the bowling balls via an in-game UI system. </p>

										<h3>Procedural Content Generation</h3>
										<h4> Cellular Automata Dungeon Creator</h4>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/70x70.gif" alt="" /></span>

										<p> Unreal Engine 5 || Blueprints </p>
										<p> During this Year 3 module, I chose to create a PCG tool prototype within UE5 that could create dungeon maps for games by using a cellular automata algorithm. This could be further expanded in the future
											to become a real tool that develops can use. </p>
										<p> I used UE5's blueprints to develop this prototype. The prototype features a UI for the user to use to set the defined ruleset for the algorithm to use, including flexibility on the size of the map and the
											density of the wall:floor ratio. The user can iterate the map generate by using the relevent button, with each iteration bring the map closer to that of a dungeon. </p>

										<p> One of the problems I overcame during the development was how the prototype would identify the neighbouring tiles on the generated map. UE5 blueprint arrays work in one-dimension and I wanted a two-dimensional
											array to store the values of the map. To overcome this, I used mathematics to construct formulas that could be used to find each neighbouring tile. For example, to find the tile to the right of the tile, the formula
											would be "x + 1", similarly, to find the tile that was directly below the tile, the formula would be "x + width". By using these formulas that I constructed, I could iterate through the one-dimensional array and find
											every neighbouring tile. I also implemented conditions into the iteration to ensure the the empty space around the map was considered in the iteration. </p>

										<h4> Procedural Dungeon Game</h4>

											<span class="image"><img src="images/tboi.gif" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image"><img src="images/gdgame2.PNG" alt="" /></span>

											<p>C# || Unity</p>
											<p> This project was inspired by The Binding of Isaac. I created a game which plays very similar to TBOI, with the dungeon being procedurally generated, randomised items spawning
											 	and random enemies throughout the rooms. I created the dungeon generation system by creating arrays of room prefabs, which upon generation, would be randomly selected from the relevent
												array. For example, if the dungeon required a room to the left of the room, it would randomly select a room which had an open door on the right to connect them together.</p>
											<p> Each dungeon was generate based upon a ruleset. Depending on the floor number that the player was on, the number of rooms that could be spawned would change. The higher the floor
												number, the more rooms that would spawn. The dungeon would spawn the number of rooms defined, then subsequently spawning a boss room and an item room as the two furthest points
												from the starting room. </p>

										<h3>Technical Games Production : Level 5 Group Work</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/group.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>C# || Unity</p>
										<p> This project was a group project during Year 2 on the Games Programming degree. We decided upon creating a top-down, zombie wave shooter game. The player can traverse the map to find guns, ammo and resources to
										fight off the zombies. Turrets can be crafted from the resources found around the map. </p>
										<p> I worked on the turrets throughout the development. Once placed, the turrets will aim towards the nearest zombie enemy within the attack radius. Once the turret is aiming at the zombie, found using a
										raycast, the turret will proceed to shoot at the enemy until it dies. Once dead, the turret will then move onto the next nearest zombie found within the radius. </p>
										<p> A problem I overcame during this project was my previous lack of Unity knowledge. This was my first experience with using Unity but I did not let this hinder me. From Week 1, I hit the ground running
										with learning as much about Unity as I could, from the basics to more advanced areas such as the raycast required for the turret. This was also the first time using GitHub in a group project and the experience
									 	I gained from this allowed me to effectively work with GitHub in future group projects.</p>
