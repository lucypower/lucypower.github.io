											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p> My name is Lucy Power and I am currently studying Computer Games Development at Staffordshire University. I have always been passsionate for games and I aspire to be apart of the next generation of game developers creating games
											to bring enjoyment to the world. I'm self-employed at uTest.com where I have gained skills in application testing and communicating with a team leader. I am also currently employed at the Student's Union, working in the university bar. </p>

										<p> In my free time I partake in extra-curricular activities and hobbies. As of the 2023-2024 academic year, I am apart of the Cheerleading team and the Rock, Alt and Metal Society. In previous years, I was also apart of the
											hockey team, filling the roll of Game Day and Social Media Secretary on the committee. Outside of university and gaming, I spend a lot of my time exploring my creative side through the means of crocheting and cross-stitching,
											often combining my love of gaming by creating game characters for both myself and others as gifts. </p>

										<h3>Procedural Content Generation : Dungeon Creator</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/70x70.gif" alt="" /></span>

										<p> Unreal Engine 5 || Blueprints </p>
										<p> The assignment for this module was to create a PCG tool within UE5. I chose a dungeon creation tool to focus on due to my love of The Binding of Isaac and the assignment
											completed in the previous year.</p>
										<p> I implemented a cellular automata algorithm that would look at each tile in the grid, find its neighbouring tiles, determine what colour the tiles are and what colour they
											should become, and then changes the tile accordingly. The tool contains UI which allows the user to define the size of the grid and the density of the wall and floor tiles.
											A generate button was present to generate the grid based off of the user defined rules, and an iterate button would run the cellular automata algorithm each time the button
											was pressed. </p>

										<h3>Games Development : Procedural Dungeon Game</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/tboi.gif" alt="" /></span>

										<p>C# || Unity</p>
										<p> This project was inspired by The Binding of Isaac. I created a game which plays very similar to TBOI, with the dungeon being procedurally generated, randomised items spawning
										 	and random enemies throughout the rooms. I created the dungeon generation system by creating arrays of room prefabs, which upon generation, would be randomly selected from the relevent
											array. For example, if the dungeon required a room to the left of the room, it would randomly select a room which had an open door on the right to connect them together.</p>
										<p> Each dungeon was generate based upon a ruleset. Depending on the floor number that the player was on, the number of rooms that could be spawned would change. The higher the floor
											number, the more rooms that would spawn. The dungeon would spawn the number of rooms defined, then subsequently spawning a boss room and an item room as the two furthest points
											from the starting room. </p>

										<h3>Game Development : Farming Game</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/gdgame1.PNG" alt="" /></span>

										<p>C#  ||  Unity</p>
										<p> This game was developed during the Game Development module in Year 2. The only limitations to the game was that it needed to be from a top-down perspective. The inspitations
										for this game were Stardew Valley and Crazy Taxi, combining the farming elements and arcade elements together. Throughout the game, the player would buy and plant seeds, water and harvest crops
										and sell them to the shopkeeper.</p>
										<p>  The game featured two modes, an arcade mode and a time-limit mode. The arcade mode gives the player 60 seconds to score as many points as they can, where each crop that was
											sold would add some additional time to the time. The time-limit mode plays the exact same but with a certain time limit in play that would not be increased with sold crops. </p>

										<h3>Games Engine Programming : Space Invaders</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/gepgame1.PNG" alt="" /></span>

										<p>C# || Unity</p>
										<p> This game was inspired by Space Invaders and combined with an original theme. The theme of the game is that the player is defending their flower garden from the space
										 	octopi which are attacking. The player uses their watering can as a weapon, firing water at the enemies. The player only has so much water in their can and is required
											to refill their weapon to continue defending. The enemies attack every so often, damaging to flowers if they are hit. Once the flowers take to many shots, they are destroyed
											forever.</p>
										<p> The player is able to destroy the enemies by hitting them with their projectiles. However, the enemies generate more enemies throughout the game. Every so often, a random
											amount of enemies will be spawned in a random location on the screen. The player must destroy all the enemies to win. </p>

										<h3> Fundamentals of Games and Graphical Systems : Pacman</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/foggs1.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p> C++ || S2D </p>
										<p> This Pacman Game was created for an assignment and was created using the S2D library which is a library created by Staffordshire University.
											The game operates like the original pacman does but in a more open area with more ghosts.</p>

										<h3>Further Games and Graphics Concepts : DirectX 11</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/FGAGSem1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>DX11 || C++</p>
										<p>This project was for the Semester 1 assignment. It was created using DX11 and C++. The program created displayed a series of objects which were loaded in with an OBJLoader, textures on all objects, and a flat triangle grid which is created via an array.
										The project utilized the Vertex and Pixel shader to create suitable lighting to display the objects correctly. </p>
										<p> </p>

										<h3>Fundamentals of Games and Graphical Systems : OpenGL</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/opengl.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>OpenGL || C++</p>
										<p>This project was made in Visual Studio C++ using OpenGL to create a 3D space. The project contains cubes and pyramids which freely rotate and reflect light.</p>
										<p> </p>

										<h3>Concurrent Network Applications : Server / Client Networking</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/server.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>C#</p>
										<p> This project explored the use of threads to create a mini server / client service. The project is currently able to communicate between all the clients via the server. In the future this will be further
										developed in order for more activities to be present on the server, such as a text-based game.</p>

										<h3>2020 Games Jam</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/skyrim.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>UE4</p>
										<p>This games jam occured during the first week of uni as a team building activity. The group I was put with created an infinite runner game where you have to both dodge obstacles and attack enemies running at you</p>
										<p> </p>

										<h3>Technical Games Production : Level 5 Group Work (2022)</h3>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/group.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>C# || Unity</p>
										<p> This group project was conducted in the first three weeks of University after Christmas. We created a zombie shooter game where the player is required to fight the waves of zombies using guns
										found around the map and turrets crafted from resources. I participated in this group work by creating the turret asset which will target the nearest enemy in it's radius and shoot it using the
										gun and bullet prefabs created by another team member. At the end of the second semester we completed this game and each achieved a 1st in the module.</p>

										<h3>Technical Games Production : Level 5 Group Work (2023)</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/tgp.PNG" alt="" /></span>

										<p>C# || Unity</p>
										<p> The game we decided upon for this group project was inspired by Ghostrunner and Neon White. The game features several different levels of various themes which the player must
											navigate through to reach the end goal. Each level has obstacles and enemies which the player must avoid by dodging and using the crossbow weapon provided. </p>
										<p> The parts of this game that I contributed to was creating the tutorial level, creating the water level, adding effects to various objects in the levels (such as
												doors opening, windmills turning and gates rising), managing the GitHub and teaching other members of the group how to effectively use GitHub. </p>

										<h3>Games Engine Programming : Unreal Engine Prototype</h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/gepgame2.PNG" alt="" /></span>

										<p> C++ || Unreal Engine 5 || Blueprints </p>
										<p> This project showcases some of the different things that are capable within UE5. This was my first time working in UE. The project showcases VFX, SFX, player movement,
											player weapon shooting, item destruction, gamemode completion, AI navigation, health and damage components and UI</p>
										<p> This project gave me an insight on how both the blueprint and C++ sides of Unreal are used and what they can do. </p>

										<h3> Virtual and Augmented Reality : AR Applications </h3>



										<p> C# || Unity </p>
										<p> I created 3 different AR applications throughout this module. One displayed an object on screen when the camera was directed at a specific picture, one which would track the users face and display an object
											(simlar to how filters found on social media work), and one was a game where the player would need to fire at the cubes in the surrounding area, destroying all the cubes to win (similar to Face Raiders on the 3DS)</p>
										<p> In addition to this, I created a main menu which would allow the player to choose which application they wanted access.</p>

										<h3> Virtual and Augmented Reality : Bowling Game </h3>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/bowling.gif" alt="" /></span>

										<p> C# || Unity </p>
										<p> This is the first game that I have made within VR. It is a bowling simulation type game, where the player can play a full, 10-round game of bowling. Each round allows the
											player to bowl twice, identical to real bowling. Subsequently, the final round of the game allows the player to bowl three times if they bowl a strike or a spare. The points system
											is different to real life bowling, with each pin counting as one point consistently throughout the game.</p>
										<p> In addition to the bowling, the environment is able to be navigated via teleportation anquors, doors can be opened and closed and objects around the environment can be picked up.
											This was to show off the various techniques used within VR development, such as pulleys, grabbable objects and snappable locations.</p>
