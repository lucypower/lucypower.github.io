								<h2>About this Project</h2>
								<p>This project is my first mobile game that I have made. It was apart of a university module focusing on mobile gaming, including monetisation, social media integration, and making fun, engaging mobile games that players want to keep playing.</p>

								<p>I was inspired to choose the genre of a simulator tycoon as this is one of my favourite types of mobile games and I knew that it was something I was passionate about making. Before this point I had only breifly worked in Unity for Android, which
									was making a simple AR game in the previous year. I learnt a lot during my lectures about mobile games and the business aspect surrounding them. Part of the assessment required a testing plan for the game, which I was able to use my experience
									as a freelance QA tester on. I ended up going pretty overboard and making a 100+ page document of my testing plan, which was accompanied by a 25 minute video of all the different test cases I carried out. </p>
