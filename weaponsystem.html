								<h2>What is this Project?</h2>
								<p>This project is one of my personal projects that I am currently working on. During my most recent group project, <a href="ascension.html" target ="_blank"> Ascension  </a> , I made the Weapon System that was present during the
								gameplay loop and utilised by each player. I made this system in Blueprints as this was what the entire project was made in. I am currently in the process of recreating this system in C++, both for my portfolio
							 	and as a means of practising my C++ and developing my skills further.</p>
								<p> As I continue through this project, I will be updating this page on my progress, including adding pictures and videos of my work, and reflecting on the project as a whole, so please keep checking back! </p>

								<h2> Currently Implemented Features </h2>
								<ul>
									<li> Weapon applies damage to a Target Dummy class that I made </li>
									<li> The player can pick up a different weapon and use it </li>
									<li> Each weapon has values assigned from a Data Table that it uses (such as the damage number) </li>
									<li> Each weapon has an ammo system which updates a UI widget </li>
								</ul>

								<h2> Planned Features </h2>
								<ul>
									<li> Player uses a linetrace + a keyboard input to pick up a weapon, instead of it being a collision event </li>
									<li> More different types of weapons </li>
									<li> Alternative fire methods, such as a burst shot on a pistol </li>
									<li> A fun gun that fires cats that then walk around the environment with Behaviour Trees (or other pathfinding AI algorithms) </li>
									<li> An inventory system, currently planned to allow for two weapons to be held at once </li>
									<li> Aim down sights mechanic </li>
								</ul>
