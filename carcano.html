								<h2>About this Project</h2>
								<p> Carcano is a couch-coop, split-screen, pvp arena shooter made in Unreal Engine 5. This project was apart of a module that I had during my final year of my undergraduate. Our team comprised of 25 different students, across multiple unique disciplines
								and across both the Stoke and London satellite campuses. </p>

								<h2> My Work in Carcano </h2>
									<p> I was apart of the development team during my time working on Carcano. I was in charge of creating the rounds system that would be used within the gameplay loop. Each round would last for certain amount of time, or until one of the players died, upon
									which point the next round would start, along with resetting the environment. Once one of the players reached 5 points, the game would end and the players would be taken back to the main menu. </p>

									<p> I also spent a lot of time working on bug fixing throughout the development of the project. We had a couple of playtest sessions with all of the other groups in the university, and I was setup on my own PC to hotfix any bugs that other players ran
									into while they were playtesting Carcano. I believe this experience helped me develop my bug fixing skills and remaining calm under the pressure of people watching me work and wanting to not wait to continue playing the game. </p>
